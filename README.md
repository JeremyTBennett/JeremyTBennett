- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JeremyTBennett. My day job is the test architect within a professional digital media where I develop and support analysis modules to allow comprehensive testing without human interaction in a DevOps environment.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in writing microservices that contain the automated analysis code so that the automated testing can be easily scaled up in the cloud. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use Go as I find the dynamic nature of Python does not produce reliable code if contained within a container running remotely. I need a language that finds most of the code errors before deployment.
